# Fraud Transactions Data Analysis

## Project Overview
Financial fraud has become a critical concern in digital transactions. This project aims to analyze and detect fraudulent transactions using data visualization techniques and statistical analysis. By examining transaction patterns, risk scores, and key fraud indicators, this study provides actionable insights into fraudulent behavior and its impact on businesses and consumers.

## Features
- **Risk Score Analysis**: Understanding risk distribution and fraud clustering.
- **Fraud Patterns Over Time**: Identifying high-risk time periods for fraudulent transactions.
- **Transaction Amount Analysis**: Studying how fraud relates to transaction values.
- **Category-Based Fraud Trends**: Examining which sectors experience the highest fraud occurrences.
- **Actionable Insights**: Strategies for fraud prevention based on data-driven patterns.

##  Dataset
- **Source**: The dataset consists of financial transaction records containing labeled fraud and non-fraud transactions.
- **Attributes**:
  - `Transaction ID`: Unique identifier for each transaction.
  - `Amount`: The monetary value of the transaction.
  - `Risk Score`: A computed value representing the likelihood of fraud.
  - `Timestamp`: The date and time of the transaction.
  - `Category`: The type of transaction (e.g., Retail, Online Services, Banking, etc.).
  - `Fraudulent (Yes/No)`: A binary label indicating fraud occurrence.

##  Installation
To run the analysis on your local machine, follow these steps:

### 1 Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/shabareesh1383/Fraud-Transactions-analysis.git
cd Fraud-Transactions-analysis
```

### 2Ô∏è Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3Ô∏è Run Jupyter Notebook
```bash
jupyter notebook
```

Open `DA.ipynb` and run the cells to generate the fraud analysis visualizations.

## Data Analysis & Key Insights
- **Fraud is not randomly distributed**: Fraudulent transactions cluster within specific risk score ranges.
- **Certain transaction amounts are more targeted**: Mid-to-high value transactions are more prone to fraud.
- **Fraud follows time-based patterns**: Higher fraud occurrences are observed during weekends and late-night hours.
- **Sector-based fraud variation**: Online services and digital goods show higher fraud rates compared to essentials.

##  Future Scope
- **Implement AI-driven fraud detection models** for real-time monitoring.
- **Integrate behavioral analytics** to adapt security measures dynamically.
- **Utilize blockchain technology** for transaction transparency and security.
