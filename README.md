Fraud Transactions Data Analysis
Overview
Financial fraud is a growing threat in today’s digital economy, affecting businesses, financial institutions, and consumers. This project aims to analyze transaction data to uncover patterns in fraudulent activities, providing key insights to enhance fraud detection and prevention strategies.

Project Objectives
Analyze risk scores to identify high-risk transactions.
Visualize fraud distribution across different parameters such as time, amount, and transaction type.
Detect trends and anomalies in fraudulent activities.
Provide actionable insights to improve fraud detection mechanisms.
Dataset
The dataset contains financial transaction records with attributes such as:

Transaction Amount – The value of the transaction.
Risk Score – A measure of the transaction's likelihood of being fraudulent.
Fraud Indicator – A binary classification (Fraud/Not Fraud).
Transaction Timestamp – The date and time of the transaction.
Transaction Type – Category of the transaction (e.g., Retail, Online Services, Banking).
Key Insights from Data Analysis
1. Risk Score Distribution
Fraudulent transactions tend to cluster within specific risk score ranges.
Non-fraudulent transactions have a broader risk score distribution, but some still appear in high-risk zones.
Using a dynamic thresholding system instead of fixed cutoffs can improve fraud detection accuracy.
2. Transaction Amount vs. Fraud Occurrence
Fraudsters often target mid-to-high-value transactions that don’t trigger instant investigations.
Extremely large transactions are less frequent in fraud cases, likely due to stricter security checks.
3. Time-Based Fraud Trends
Fraudulent transactions are more frequent during late-night hours and weekends, when manual security checks are minimal.
Real-time fraud detection systems can be enhanced by factoring in high-risk time windows.
4. Fraud Patterns Across Different Categories
Online services and luxury retail see more fraudulent transactions than essential goods.
Subscription-based fraud occurs due to stolen credit card testing on small purchases before larger fraud attempts.
Technologies Used
Python for data analysis and visualization.
Pandas for data preprocessing and manipulation.
Matplotlib & Seaborn for graphical insights.
Jupyter Notebook for interactive analysis.
